## Introduction

LaplaceGNN is a scalable graph learning framework that leverages spectral bootstrapping and adversarial training to improve the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs). This repository contains the implementation of LaplaceGNN, along with scripts for training and evaluation.

## Features 

- **Spectral Bootstrapping**: Enhances the learning process by incorporating spectral information from the graph.
- **Adversarial Training**: Improves model robustness by training with adversarial examples.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale graphs efficiently.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train the LaplaceGNN model, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model, use:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config config.yaml
```

## Configuration

The configuration file `config.yaml` contains various parameters for training and evaluation. Modify this file to suit your needs.

## Examples

### Example 1: Node Classification

```bash
python train.py --config configs/node_classification.yaml
```

### Example 2: Graph Classification

```bash
python train.py --config configs/graph_classification.yaml
```
